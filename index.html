<h1>Getting Started</h1>

Within your index.html, you must include a section with a basic Getting Started guide. Reviewers will follow all steps in the Getting Started guide at the beginning of the evaluation period and if necessary can relay questions if they run into difficulties. You should write your Getting Started guide to be as simple and straightforward as possible, and yet it should stress the key elements of your artifact. If well written, anyone who has successfully completed the Getting Started guide should not have any technical difficulties with the rest of your artifact. The Getting Started guide is your only opportunity to allow “debugging” of your artifact. Once the reviewers have completed this phase, there will be no further opportunity for interaction with you, the authors.
