<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<!--
Within your index.html, you must include a section with a basic Getting Started guide.
Reviewers will follow all steps in the Getting Started guide at the beginning of the evaluation
period and if necessary can relay questions if they run into difficulties. You should write your
Getting Started guide to be as simple and straightforward as possible, and yet it should stress the
key elements of your artifact. If well written, anyone who has successfully completed the Getting
Started guide should not have any technical difficulties with the rest of your artifact. The Getting
Started guide is your only opportunity to allow “debugging” of your artifact. Once the reviewers
have completed this phase, there will be no further opportunity for interaction with you, the
authors.

<ul>
<li>Start the virtual machine with configuration file <a href="vm/I-EPOS.vmx">vm/I-EPOS.vmx</a> and virtual disk <a href="vm/I-EPOS.vmx">vm/I-EPOS.vmdk</a>.
<br/>
The virtual machine was created with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/playerpro-evaluation.html">VMWare Player</a>.
</li>
<li>Login to user "I-EPOS VM" with password "iepos"</li>
<li>Now let us try to execute the program.<br>
Start the file "I-EPOS" on the desktop with a double click.</li>
<li>The configuration window opens. This is the place where the simulation can be configured. It should look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/configuration.png"/></li>
<li>Click the "Run" button to start the simulation.</li>
<li>After a few seconds the result window should appear, showing the results of the simulation. More about that later. The window should look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/results.png"/></li>
<li>Click on the "Next" button in order to view the results of the second iteration. The bottom part of the result window should have changed.
The window should now look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/results2.png"/></li>
