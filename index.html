<h1>The I-EPOS Project</h1>

I-EPOS is open source and accessible on <a href="https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS">https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS</a>.
The experimental live version is currently a branch of the I-EPOS repository and is accessible via <a href="https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS/tree/LiveExperiment">https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS/tree/LiveExperiment</a>
The live version runs each agent in a separate process and can therefore be run in a computer network.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<!--
Within your index.html, you must include a section with a basic Getting Started guide.
Reviewers will follow all steps in the Getting Started guide at the beginning of the evaluation
period and if necessary can relay questions if they run into difficulties. You should write your
Getting Started guide to be as simple and straightforward as possible, and yet it should stress the
key elements of your artifact. If well written, anyone who has successfully completed the Getting
Started guide should not have any technical difficulties with the rest of your artifact. The Getting
Started guide is your only opportunity to allow “debugging” of your artifact. Once the reviewers
have completed this phase, there will be no further opportunity for interaction with you, the
authors.

<ul>
<li>Start the virtual machine with configuration file <a href="vm/I-EPOS.vmx">vm/I-EPOS.vmx</a> and virtual disk <a href="vm/I-EPOS.vmx">vm/I-EPOS.vmdk</a>.
<br/>
The virtual machine was created with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/playerpro-evaluation.html">VMWare Player</a>.
</li>
<li>Login to user "I-EPOS VM" with password "iepos"</li>
<li>Now let us try to execute the program.<br>
Start the file "I-EPOS" on the desktop with a double click.</li>
<li>The configuration window opens. This is the place where the simulation can be configured. It should look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/configuration.png"/></li>
<li>Click the "Run" button to start the simulation.</li>
<li>After a few seconds the result window should appear, showing the results of the simulation. More about that later. The window should look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/results.png"/></li>
<li>Click on the "Next" button in order to view the results of the second iteration. The bottom part of the result window should have changed.
The window should now look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/results2.png"/></li>
</ul>

<h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
<!--
how you propose to evaluate your artifact; where appropriate, include descriptions of and links
to files (included in the archive) that represent expected outputs
(e.g., the log files expected to be generated by your tool on the given inputs). 
-->


<!--
  - step-by-step instructions:
    - execute in one application domain
      illustrate use case and how I-EPOS helps improve the situation
    - describe what can be optimized (default: zero.target)
    - local cost influence
    - what we want to show: learning rate converges fast
    - describe agent changes

<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="datasets">datasets/</a></td>
<td>Contains sample datasets for I-EPOS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="datasets/bicycle">datasets/bicycle/</a></td>
<td>
The bicycle dataset. It contains data of a bicycle sharing system.
Each user of this system is represented as an agent.
The possible plans of each agent are encoded as a vector with values as the incoming
minus the outgoing bicycles of a user in each station at a
certain time slot. For example, a user traveling from station 1
to station 3 and from station 4 to station 3 has the following
plan: (−1, 0, 2, −1, . . .). I-EPOS can select recommended
stations for each user agent such that the number of bicycles
among the stations remains balanced.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="datasets/energy">datasets/energy/</a></td>
<td>
The energy dataset. It contains data about the electricity consumption of households.
Each household is represented as an agent.
The possible plans of each agent are encoded as a vector with each value being the electricity consumption at one point in time.
I-EPOS can be used to select plans in a way that electricity demand peaks are reduced.

The possible plans of each agent are drawn from a multivariate standard normal distribution.
