<h1>The I-EPOS Project</h1>

I-EPOS is open source and accessible on <a href="https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS">https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS</a>.
The experimental live version is currently a branch of the I-EPOS repository and is accessible via <a href="https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS/tree/LiveExperiment">https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS/tree/LiveExperiment</a>
The live version runs each agent in a separate process and can therefore be run in a computer network.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<!--
Within your index.html, you must include a section with a basic Getting Started guide.
Reviewers will follow all steps in the Getting Started guide at the beginning of the evaluation
period and if necessary can relay questions if they run into difficulties. You should write your
Getting Started guide to be as simple and straightforward as possible, and yet it should stress the
key elements of your artifact. If well written, anyone who has successfully completed the Getting
Started guide should not have any technical difficulties with the rest of your artifact. The Getting
Started guide is your only opportunity to allow “debugging” of your artifact. Once the reviewers
have completed this phase, there will be no further opportunity for interaction with you, the
authors.

<ul>
<li>Start the virtual machine with configuration file <a href="vm/I-EPOS.vmx">vm/I-EPOS.vmx</a> and virtual disk <a href="vm/I-EPOS.vmx">vm/I-EPOS.vmdk</a>.
<br/>
The virtual machine was created with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/playerpro-evaluation.html">VMWare Player</a>.
</li>
<li>Login to user "I-EPOS VM" with password "iepos"</li>
<li>Now let us try to execute the program.<br>
Start the file "I-EPOS" on the homescreen with a double click.</li>
<li>The configuration window opens. This is the place where the simulation can be configured. It should look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/configuration.png"/></li>
<li>Click the "Run" button to start the simulation.</li>
<li>After a few seconds the result window should appear, showing the results of the simulation. More about that later. The window should look as follows:
<br/>
<img src="img/results.png"/></li>
<li>Click on the "Next" button in order to view the results of the second iteration. The bottom part of the result window should have changed.
The window should now look as follows:

The instructions assume that the VM is started, the user logged in and on the homescreen as described in Getting Started.

<ol type="A">
<li><p>
We consider a bicycle sharing system implemented in a city. Stations are set up all across the city, providing space for several bicycles each.
As users drive across the city they move bicycles between the different stations. We notice that over time some stations are lacking bicycles, while others run out of bicycle storage.
We try to solve this problem with I-EPOS.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Start I-EPOS from the homescreen.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the dataset by clicking the "Browse" button right of the "Data Set Location",
and selecting the directory "bicycle".
</p></li>
<li><p>
We want the change in the number of bicycles stored in each station to be zero.
Therefore, we leave the "Global Cost Location" at "zero.target".
</p></li>
<li><p>
For now we are only interested in minimizing the global cost, so please set the "Local Cost Influence"
to 0.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Click the "Run" button to start the simulation.
</p></li>
<li><p>
While I-EPOS is executing, it tries to find combinations of user plans that make the total change in
the number of bikes (referred to as global response) as small as possible.
When the result window opens, it shows in the top section how the algorithm managed to reduce the
global cost from its initial guess over a course of multiple iterations. The global cost is the
squared distance of the global response from the target vector, that we left at zero in this example.
</p><p>
On the bottom left we see the global response after the first iteration.
Each dimension in this plot represents the change in the number of bikes for one bicycle station.
The initial guess of the algorithm shows that at the end of the observed period, a station is missing
16 bikes. If plans were selected at random (i.e. if users can travel however they like), that change
would be even greater.
</p><p>
On the bottom right we see the network of agents. Each agent that changed its selection compared to
the previous iteration is marked with the color black.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Navigate through the iterations using the buttons "Next" and "Previous" to see how I-EPOS manages to
improve the global response step by step.
Notice that in the end I-EPOS is able to stabilize all stations so far that they loose or gain one
bicycle at most, compared to the 16 in the first iteration.
</p><p>
Furthermore, the changes in the network show that only certain groups of agents change their selection
in each iteration. This is a result of the way I-EPOS merges changes together. Some agents are told not
to change their selections in order to not hurt the overall performance.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Close the report window, so that you are back at the homescreen.
</p></li>
</ol>

</li>

<li><p>
We notice that the users don't like the suggestions our system makes.
If the users could freely choose their plans, the global response would be as follows:
</p><img src="img/bicycle_ml.png"/>
<p>
In order to make the system more appealing to users, we have to consider their preferences,
encoded in the local cost.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Start I-EPOS from the homescreen.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the bicycle dataset again as explained above.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Set the "Local Cost Influence" to 0.9
</p></li>
<li><p>
Click the "Run" button to start the simulation.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In the result window we can see that the global response (bottom left) is already pretty similar
to the user preferred result. However, I-EPOS manages to turn this initial solution that many users
like into a solution with much lower global cost without sacrifycing on the local cost.
The local cost is represented as dashed line in the plot at the top.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Navigate through the iterations again using the buttons "Next" and "Previous" to see how I-EPOS
manages to improve the global response step by step.
Notice that the global response is not as stable as it was in our previous simulation, but the local
cost is close to optimum at around 0.004.
</p></li>
</ol>

The bicycle dataset. It contains data of a bicycle sharing system.
Each user of this system is represented as an agent.
The possible plans of each agent are encoded as a vector with values as the incoming
minus the outgoing bicycles of a user in each station at a
certain time slot. For example, a user traveling from station 1
to station 3 and from station 4 to station 3 has the following
plan: (−1, 0, 2, −1, . . .). I-EPOS can select recommended
stations for each user agent such that the number of bicycles
among the stations remains balanced.

Each household is represented as an agent.
The possible plans of each agent are encoded as a vector with each value being the electricity consumption at one point in time.
I-EPOS can be used to select plans in a way that electricity demand peaks are reduced.
